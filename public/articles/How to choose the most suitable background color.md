Using a suitable background color can attract more traffic to my website or post, here are some colors I collected from the internet.

### The most eye-friendly color

Designers tend to use **colors that are easy on the eyes** to minimize strain during prolonged screen time.

| **Color Name**        | **Hex Code** | **Why it’s eye-friendly**                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Soft Green**        | `#A8D5BA`    | Green is calming and **least fatiguing** to the eyes.      |
| **Warm Beige**        | `#F5F5DC`    | Gentle background that gives a **paper-like feel**.        |
| **Light Grey**        | `#F0F0F0`    | Neutral, non-distracting, and **reduces contrast stress**. |
| **Pastel Blue**       | `#DDEEFF`    | Cool, calming, and **soothing for long reading**.          |
| **Cream / Off-White** | `#FFFDD0`    | Softer than pure white; **reduces glare**.                 |
